# Development changelog

Latest release: **0.4.2** ([`v0.4.2`](https://github.com/HeduroFR/42tui-client/releases/tag/v0.4.2)).
Package version: **0.4.2**. The working tree also contains unreleased tester changes;
the published patch uses isolated commit `0f3f4c3642e11f39a958fbe89e09a0d4e868b1d9`.
Suggested next release: **0.5.0** (minor), for the unreleased tester setup below.
A release is worth preparing; native Docker/macOS validation and fresh candidate
checks remain required before publication. No version bump is authorized here.

This file tracks implemented changes since the latest release. Keep published
history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Maintenance, version selection and reset
instructions are in [distribution operations](docs/distribution.md#development-changelog).

## Changes since 0.4.2

### Changed behavior

- **2026-10-27 · minor · Tester setup:** replace separate install/start/docs/recheck
  controls with one Run action per tester. Preserve compact image removal, locking,
  pinned sources, platform-specific images, mount checks and captured project paths.
  Setup uses no sudo, package-manager installs, system service changes or socket/group
  permission changes. Linux uses an accessible existing engine and can start an
  existing rootless user service. macOS installs Desktop under `~/Applications`
  through an unprivileged DMG mount, staged copy, signature verification and rename;
  failed copies remain retryable. Keep Desktop's user-level defaults.
  Build pinned `.git` sources inside Docker BuildKit without host Git, preserving
  Git metadata. Other custom HTTPS clone URLs retain the existing-Git fallback and
  give explicit guidance if Git is absent. Update README, French/Spanish copy and
  focused regressions. Reference: `3ea93ab`, [PR #13](https://github.com/HeduroFR/42tui-client/pull/13).


### Internal changes and documentation

- **2026-10-28 · no release required · Verified 0.4.2 publication:** after explicit
  tag/publication authorization, publish isolated candidate
  `0f3f4c3642e11f39a958fbe89e09a0d4e868b1d9`, integrated through
  [PR #19](https://github.com/HeduroFR/42tui-client/pull/19) as `b758138`.
  Close superseded PR #18. The patch contains update discovery, exam resumption
  filtering and first-run instructions; later tester features are excluded.
  [Release run 40603624612](https://github.com/HeduroFR/42tui-client/actions/runs/40603624612)
  passed all checks and both publishers. GitHub publication completed at
  2026-10-27T23:44:03Z. Verify all seven release assets/checksums and byte equality
  of both PyPI downloads and GitHub distributions against original CI artifacts.
  Wheel SHA-256: `86c9c66805ffe0358b36aade07e971bfb0be8b05f05e681b4fdb924f073ee6a0`;
  sdist: `f3383f18264f61d5a4e1a56bff7d25fec6dddce49b8c7dd314e9bcc03fdf3352`.
  A disposable unpinned uv installation ran the real `42tui update` from 0.4.1
  to 0.4.2, preserved a local-data sentinel and passed installed CLI/resource smoke.
  Initial PyPI metadata/index propagation briefly returned 404/0.4.1; retry succeeded
  without changing the tag, rebuilding or republishing. Tool/data/cache paths stayed
  under /tmp; no real user data or credentials were used.
  Exact-candidate compatibility run 40600874913 passed three synthetic friend-preview
  pairs against backend e917aca with 0.4.0 as oldest supported client. This patch
  changes no API or backend behavior; no new backend deployment was required.
  Live Intra writes and full API coverage remain outside that scenario.
  Advance only the verified baseline, clear shipped preparation records and complete
  TODO/plan checklists, retaining unreleased tester behavior and validation below.
  Checks for this documentation: diff, release evidence and relative links reviewed.
  No additional product release is needed for this documentation reset.

## Validation and release readiness

The 0.4.2 publication is verified. Pending release work belongs to 0.5.0 tester
setup; the successful patch release does not validate native tester installation.

### Tester setup validation (2026-10-27)

- Adapter tests: 54 passed, covering no privileged setup commands, managed-school
  Docker missing/denied/stopped, user-only rootless startup, per-user macOS discovery,
  pinned remote builds without host Git, safe custom clone fallback, Git metadata,
  interrupted Mac copy cleanup/retry, timeout and terminal operation boundaries.
- Read-only reviews found partial-copy retry and custom-build compatibility gaps;
  reproduced each with failing regressions, fixed and verified the adapter suite.
  Linux rootless-service approval copy now describes Linux startup correctly.
- Final tester scope: 70 passed in 54.868 seconds using the runner-only heartbeat.
  Locale checks: 2 passed; new setup/error strings have French/Spanish coverage.
  Scope ownership: all 820 discovered tests assigned exactly once. Diff whitespace
  check passed. The full suite was not run locally.
- Ordinary UI runs stalled during Python 3.14 asyncio executor shutdown in this
  sandbox after successful assertions. A temporary runner-only event-loop heartbeat
  resolves the wakeup stall; product and test files contain no workaround.
- A WSL2/Ubuntu 26.04 probe confirmed Docker is absent here. The earlier privileged
  installation attempt stopped at the sandbox's no-new-privileges guard before any
  package changes. The final WSL probe selected no installation plan, produced the
  school-Docker guidance, executed zero host setup commands and released the lock.
- Native school Docker access, real container builds and native macOS installation
  remain unverified. Full-suite/CI remain release gates. Flake8 is unavailable.
- The tester feature merits a minor release (0.5.0) after published 0.4.2.
  Native school Docker access and macOS installation remain unverified. CI for
  PR #16 passed all 21 jobs, including the tester scope; future candidates still
  require their own exact revision checks.

### PR #13 merge validation (2026-10-27)

- Conflict markers removed; both unreleased tester work and main's release record
  retained. Standard tester scope: 70 passed in 51.827 seconds, without the earlier
  heartbeat workaround. Correction scope: 52 passed in 15.306 seconds. Locale
  checks: 2 passed. All 823 discovered tests have exactly one scope owner; staged
  whitespace checks passed. Full suite and native Docker/Mac integration not rerun.
- Unrelated companion work in the primary checkout is excluded from this worktree.
